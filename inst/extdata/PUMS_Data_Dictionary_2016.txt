Note for both Industry and Occupation lists in Data Dictionary:

*  In cases where the SOC occupation code ends in X(s) or Y(s), two or more SOC occupation codes were aggregated to correspond to a specific Census occupation code. In these cases, the Census occupation description is used for the SOC occupation title.

** These codes are pseudo codes developed by the Census Bureau and are not official or equivalent NAICS or SOC codes.

Legend to Identify NAICS Equivalents
	M = Multiple NAICS code
	P = Part of a NAICS code - NAICS code split between two or more Census codes
	S = Not specified Industry in NAICS sector - Specific to Census codes only
	Z = Exception to NAICS code - Part of NAICS industry but has a unique Census code

Note: For additional information on NAICS and SOC groupings within major categories visit our website at: https://www.census.gov/people/io/methodology/indexes.html.

*** Refer to top-coding documentation at: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/pums/documentation.html 

**** The World Area of Birth (WAOB) in the PUMS dataset is based upon the Place of Birth (POB) variable in the full dataset, not the Place of Birth recode created for PUMS (POBP).  POB contains more detailed place of birth information than POBP.  Therefore, WAOB cannot be recoded from POBP.

Data users should be aware that the area groupings for WAOB are based primarily upon United States administrative boundaries, not geographic boundaries.  For example, Guam is grouped into "Puerto Rico and the U.S. Island Areas," although geographically it is located in Oceania.  Not all places of birth are listed individually in POBP.  Therefore the user cannot recreate an exact world area of birth variable from POBP based upon geographic location of birth.
