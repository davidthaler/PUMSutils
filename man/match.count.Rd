\title{Count number of persons in households matching a list of conditions.}
\usage{
match.count(house, pop, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{house}{ACS housing data or subset with the \code{SERIALNO} field}

\item{pop}{ACS population data or subset with the \code{SERIALNO} field}

\item{...}{a list of conditions that define the subset,
as bare expressions, not as strings}
}
\value{
a 2-column data frame with columns \code{SERIALNO} and
       a result column called either \code{n} or \code{result.name}
}
\description{
Counts the rows in the population table, grouped by household,
that match a list of conditions given as the \code{...} argument,
filling \code{NA} values with 0.
The result can be joined to the housing data on \code{SERIALNO},
and the housing weights (called \code{WGTP}) should be used to
compute estimates.
